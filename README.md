# Iris Dataset Classification using Decision Tree

This repository contains a solution for the Iris dataset classification problem using a Decision Tree model. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of **97%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying the different species of Iris flowers.

## Overview
The Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three species (*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*). Each sample includes four features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The goal is to classify the species of iris flowers based on these features.

## Model
A Decision Tree Classifier was used to solve this problem. The model was trained on the dataset and evaluated for accuracy.

### Highlights:
- Achieved an accuracy of **97%** on the test data.
- Utilized the `scikit-learn` library for model implementation.
- Performed data preprocessing, splitting, training, and evaluation.

## Installation
To replicate the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/askarikzm/Calculas_project.git
   ```


## Usage
1. Run the script to train and test the Decision Tree model:
   ```bash
   python iris_decision_tree.py
   ```
2. The script will output the accuracy of the model along with a visualization of the Decision Tree.


## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Results
The model was trained and tested on the Iris dataset, achieving the following performance:
- **Accuracy**: 97%

### Decision Tree Visualization
A visualization of the Decision Tree is generated to help understand the model's decision-making process.
